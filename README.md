# Capstone-project
The title of my project is called Monster. 
b. The purpose of this project is to create a single player game where they play as a monster that has to survive in a toxic environment, defending themselves from other monsters and soldiers. 
c. Goal: I want to have finished the movement mechanics (for not only the plauer but the other monsters and soldiers), creating a timer, and the functions for eating and being eaten/killed. I would also like to have the actual art part of the game, such as environment and character design. However, it is not the priority, so more time will be dedicated to the actual foundations of the game. 
d. Technology used: This game will use pygame on python.
